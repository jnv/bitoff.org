title: "Is Twitter API Free? I've built a website to find out"

Last week Twitter announced the end of free access to its public API. The announcement came in a way very characteristic for the current leadership: [in a Tweet][announcement], just a single week before the change, lacking any details (like pricing), and only a [vague promise of more information](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621027418680229888).

Today is February 8th, one day before the announced deadline. No further information were provided on the TwitterDev account, community forums, or developer newsletter. Only more vague promises of a free “write-only API for bots providing good content”. Inside a [reply tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1622082025166442505).

To help fellow developers, I've made a website to provide a definitive answer to the question: [**Is Twitter API Free?**](https://istwitterapifree.com/).

## A single-serving site

There's a long tradition of [single-serving sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-serving_site), like [Tired.com](http://tired.com/) or [Zombo.com](https://zombo.com/). I wanted to build a single-serving site of my own, and this seemed like a good opportunity to make some fun out of this chaotic situation.

It's also telling that Ryan King, Twitter employee number 33, [relaunched](https://theryanking.com/post/is-twitter-down/) his [Is Twitter Down?](https://istwitterdown.com/) site after more than a decade, reminding the old days of Fail Whale.

## Behind the scenes

I could've just make a static HTML site, type in “Yes”, and change it to “No” once it'd be clear Twitter pulled the plug. Obviously, I overengineered the whole thing.

The website is periodically regenerated by GitHub Actions and deployed to GitHub Pages. During the build, a single Twitter API call is made for the existence of the [announcement tweet][announcement].

I have no idea Twitter API wants to communicate the paid access, but I assume that either the API call will fail somehow. It's also possible Twitter might remove the tweet if Mr. “Chef Twit” changes his mind. So the success or failure of the call decides what is shown on the page.

I challenged myself to avoid any extra packages, so the [generator logic][source] is written in vanilla JavaScript with a few Node.js built-in libraries. I'm using the built-in `fetch` function, which is available without any flags since Node.js 18.

## The bots and the feed

The joke wouldn't be complete without a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/IsTwApiFree) and a [Mastodon bot](https://masto.ai/@istwitterapifree) (of course). I didn't want to write the bots though, so I used
