title: 'The API Dispatch #9: Podcasts Holiday Special'
description: >
  The end of the year is near, so I wanted to make a special edition of this newsletter – a holiday special. Surely you have a lot of stuff to read. But what about something to listen to?

The API Dispatch is a series I started as an internal newsletter at work. It's also available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/r-d-api-mewsletter-7305909196418396160/).

Originally published on December 16, 2025.

Whether you’ll be dozing in a food coma or finally picking up that New Year’s resolution to start running, hopefully you’ll find this selection of API-related podcasts (and video channels) as informative and (sometimes) entertaining as I do.

## [APIs You Won’t Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/tag/podcast/)

([Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apis-you-wont-hate/id1281303012), [Pocket Casts](https://pca.st/5M6f))

I shared a few articles from APIs You Won’t Hate in this newsletter already, but did you know that Phil Sturgeon and Mike Bifulco also host a podcast? Most episodes are around 40 minutes in length with various guests from the API industry, talking about their experiences and projects.

I have particularly enjoyed the [latest episode with Kin Lane](https://apisyouwonthate.com/podcast/building-a-sustainable-future-in-apis-with-kin-lane/) – it’s a very frank talk about Kin’s long experience, API Evangelist persona, and critical view of the industry. Another favorite of mine is the [interview with Dave Shanley](https://apisyouwonthate.com/podcast/vacuum-wiretap-quobix/) (aka Quobix) about the Vacuum OpenAPI Specification linter and other projects Quobix is working on under Princess Beef Heavy Industries.

## [The API Experience](https://boomi.com/boomi-podcast/)

([Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-api-experience-podcast/id1698168565), [Pocket Casts](https://pca.st/n1w7r5vh))

> Greetings, children of the technology world! You've joined us to explore the possibilities of the technologies of the future here on the API Experience.

(Well, okay, that was just in a single episode.)

Hosted by Matt McLarty from Boomi and Mike Amundsen, the episodes are typically between 40 to 60 minutes. It’s a mix of interviews and discussions between hosts covering both recent developments in the API world, as well as trips into the history of the technology industry.

From the latter, I can recommend [A Brief History Of Composability](https://boomi.com/boomi-podcast/?p=s1-e12-a-brief-history-of-composability) which goes all the way back to Object Oriented Programming origins through Service Oriented Architecture to microservices and REST. On the interview side, [The Role of APIs in Knowledge Flow](https://boomi.com/boomi-podcast/?p=s2-e8-the-role-of-apis-in-knowledge-flow) with Diana Montalion is a deep dive into the essence of information and knowledge (it’s really good, trust me). Also, the [interview with Tim O’Reilly](https://boomi.com/boomi-podcast/?p=s2-e11-from-the-origin-of-apis-to-the-future-of-ai) (yes, _that_ O’Reilly with the animal book covers) is a pretty thorough – and critical – retrospective on the development of the industry, since and around, Web 2.0.

## [A(P)I Resilience](https://pronovix.com/podcasts?f%5B0%5D=podcast_category%3A17)

([Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-p-i-resilience/id1516437015), [Pocket Casts](https://pca.st/ino9fm9h))

Initially, I didn’t have high expectations when I ran into this podcast. But after listening to almost 4 hours of a 2-part interview with Jeff Eaton about [pattern languages](https://pronovix.com/podcasts/pattern-languages-and-semantic-caching-discussion-jeff-eaton-part-1) and [the future of content management](https://pronovix.com/podcasts/future-content-management-discussion-jeff-eaton-part-2) I was hooked. The podcast host, Kristof Van Tomme, goes _deep_ in conversations with his guests. Still, most episodes are around 45 minutes to 1 hour.

My other favorite episode is the [interview with Michaela Halliwell](https://pronovix.com/podcasts/api-productization-and-governance-discussion-michaela-halliwell) about API productization and governance – and the need for APIs in the heavy civil construction industry.

## Still not enough?

Have you gone through these recommendations and still looking for a dessert? Here are some additional recommendations.

[APIs Over IPAs](https://www.moesif.com/blog/podcasts/) is a series of interviews hosted by Derric Gilling from Moesif. You will find the usual suspects there, like [Mike Amundsen](https://www.moesif.com/blog/podcasts/api-product-management/Podcast-With-Mike-Amundsen/) and [Kin Lane](https://www.moesif.com/blog/podcasts/api-product-management/Podcast-With-Kin-Lane-the-API-Evangelist/). The show takes occasional hiatuses, but just this year brought 6 new episodes, so hopefully it returns next year.

No API-related podcast list would be complete without mentioning Kin Lane’s API [API Evangelist Conversations](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/). The episodes are short and to the point, usually no longer than 20 minutes.

If you prefer video, make sure to check out Erik Wilde’s [Getting APIs to Work](http://www.youtube.com/@ErikWilde) YouTube channel. Zuplo’s [API Excellence](https://www.youtube.com/@Zuplo) is also a great source.

Also, I’m contractually obliged (not really) to mention [Mews R&D Podcast](https://developers.mews.com/category/podcast/) from fellow Mewsers. With its recent introduction on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mews-r-d-podcast/id1846702992) I can finally call it a proper podcast. Specifically for APIs, check out the [mini episode with Sylvia Tang](https://developers.mews.com/mews-rd-minipodcast-with-sylvia-tang/) and the [interview with “Mr. Connectivity” Víťa Samek](https://developers.mews.com/mews-rnd-podcast-with-vita-samek/).

And for something completely different, if you’ve found most of the recommendations too boring and A(P)I Resilience too much of easy listening, try [Feeling of Computing](https://feelingof.com/episodes/) podcast (formerly known as Future of Coding). Actually, I’m hesitant to call it a podcast – each episode is like a sound artwork, with very specific editing, short music inserts, in-jokes, and tangents. _So many tangents…_

Did you enjoy – or hate – any of these recommendations? Did I miss your favorite podcast? Let me know!

I’ll be back with a regular issue in January. In the meantime, enjoy the holidays and 'api New Year!
